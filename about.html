            <h1>ABOUT THE APP:</h1>
            <p>The DiGeo Jobs app is being created in hopes of granting children and students far more opportunities to make money and develop their skills as entrepreneurs, 
                especially in difficult times like this due to COVID-19. Ever since I was young I would find ways to make money, whether it was cutting lawns, 
                painting fences, etc. The main challenge I always had to face was actually finding people who need this work done. It is a daunting, and extremely time consuming, 
                task as a young child to knock door to door trying to find people who need things such as yard work done. This app is needed more than ever during this pandemic 
                when money is harder to come by and the "knocking door to door" approach is unsafe. This app provides a solution for both the children searching for safe jobs, 
                as well as adults who do not know of, or feel like searching for, kids wanting to complete these jobs for them. The app allows for jobs to be located, completed, 
                and paid for with absolutely zero contact, thus maintaining social distancing and eliminating the unneeded difficulty of finding a customer or young entrepreneur. 
                This also allows the child to be paid at any time even when the adult may be busy and not feel like getting cash from the bank, thus reducing unwanted headaches. 
            <br/><br/>
                Below is the concept for the main screen of the app where a user can see listed jobs as one of the multiple pin drop types listed in the legend in the top right. 
                The user will be able to scroll through the map and tap a pin drop to view more details about the job. The user will also have a personal profile (bottom left button) 
                where they can customize their profile and view many graphs and data about their income/jobs completed for them through the app. Adults can list a job using the 
                bottom-middle plus button and fill out the required information.   
            <br/>

            <br/>
                With this platform we will also be able to make entrepreneurship feel far more fun for kids and students by having many special events running where it makes the app 
                feel like a game (see picture above). There will be many fun and motivating prizes on top of the cash that they are already making which is sure to create a far more 
                exciting experience and keep them using the app!
            <br/><br/>

            <h1>ABOUT THE CREATOR:</h1>
            <p>My name is Dane Gledhill and I study Computer Science and Statistics at University of Toronto. I am highly motivated to put my skills with technology to use
                to help inspire our future generation to chase their dreams, no matter how difficult. I wish to be an example that kids can one day look up to and see that they 
                can do anything no matter how many people say it is impossible, as long as they put their everything into it and never take no as an answer. I will work tirelessly
                to make sure that I can become this beacon of hope and inspiration for them and push our society into the future, one bold step at a time!
